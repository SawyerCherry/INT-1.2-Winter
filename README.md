# Turkey The Town

Turkey the town is a non-profit that My mom started.Since Thanksgiving of 2018, we have delivered a hot thanksgiving meal to almost 3000 people in our rural community. I built this to streamline taking orders, and to help with organization of delivering groceries, and taking donations. as of right now, our paypal will not allow us to do this, but we are working on it and will have the sight up, hopefully on the link: turkeythetown.org.
